- Use

- In general: We normally use the present perfect to talk about past events that have a connexion with the present; for example, news or past experiences. We can also use the present perfect to talk about situations that started in the past, but which are still true in the present.

- Use 1 / Past recent events: We use the present perfect to talk about recent events or news. We don’t say when these events happened. Or with time expressions including now.
Examples
I’ve passed the test!
She’s broken her arm.
She's had a accident.
The president has travelled to Cuba.
-- Using time expressions:
---- Just / Already / Yet
     - Just: we use just in (+) sentences to say that something happened very recently (like minutes ago).
     "I’ve just seen Peter in the street."
     "He is looks happy because he’s just got married."
     - Yet: We use yet in (-) and (?) sentences. We put it at the end of the sentence.
     Have you washed the dishes yet?
     I haven’t called him yet.
     She hasn’t arrived yet.
     - Already: We use already in (+) sentences to say that something happened before now (usually, earlier than we expected).
     I have already finished.
     We have already arrived.
     "Have you finished yet?" "Yes, I've already finished."
---- Recently:
     Have you seen any good films recently?
---- Today / This week / This month / etc.:
     I haven't seen Ted today. Maybe he isn't feeling well.

- Use 2 / Past experiences: We often use the present perfect to talk about past experiences in our lives. We don’t say when these experiences happened.
Examples
We've been to Rome and Florence.
I haven't read that book.
I’ve run the Boston marathon twice.
She’s never been on a cruise. 
I’ve been here before.
-- Using time expressions...
---- Never / Ever / Before
     - Ever: When we ask about someone’s life experiences we often use the word ever.
     Have you ever read this book?
     Have you ever been to India?
     - Never / Before: When we talk about life experiences, we often use the words never or before.
     She has never been late.
     I think I have seen this film before.
     "Have you ever read it?" "I have never read it"
---- Superlative + EVER
     This is the best food I've ever tried
---- Number of times until now
     I've seen this film three times

- Use 3 / Unfinished situations: situations that started in the past and have not finished
Examples
How long have you been here?
I have been here all day.
-- Using time expressions...
---- How long / for / since: We use the present perfect with the words "how long", "for", "since" to talk about actions or situations that started in the past and still continue or are still true now.
     - How long: We use how long in questions to ask about the duration of an action or situation.
     How long has she been a teacher?
How long has she had her car?
     - For: We use for + a period of time, e.g. for two weeks, for ten years, for ten days, for a few hours, etc.
     They have been married for 25 years. (=They got married 25 years ago and they are still married)
     We’ve been here for a few hours. 
     They’ve been married for 10 years.
     - Since: We use since + a moment in the past (the beginning of a period of time), e.g. since I was born, since 10 o’clock, since last Wednesday, etc.
     I’ve lived in Oslo since I was born. (=I was born in Oslo and I still live in Oslo)
     We’ve been here since 4 o’clock. 
     They’ve been married since 2010.
---- All + time expression
     I've lived in this house all my life
---- Lately
     We have been very busy lately

- Common mistakes
-- We use present perfect, and not present simple for actions or situations that started in the past and are still true now.
Example
We've been friends since first grade. (NOT We are friends since first grade.)
-- We don't use the word ago with the present perfect.
Example
They've been married for 10 years. (NOT They are married since 10 years ago.)

******* Present perfect or past simple?

Present perfect: We use the present perfect to talk about recent events or about people’s experiences when the time when these events happened is not important and we don’t mention it.
Examples
I’ve been to Malaysia. (When is not important. The important thing is that I have this experience now.)
She’s won three gold medals.
I’ve broken my arm.

Past simple: We use past simple to talk about completed actions in the past. We often say or ask when these actions happened.
Examples
We went to Malaysia last year.  (NOT We have been to Malaysia last year.)
She won three gold medals at the last Olympic Games. 
When did you break your arm?

In conversation: We often start a conversation about recent events or people’s experiences using the present perfect, but if we continue talking or asking about the details of that event, we use the past simple.
Examples
John: I’ve been to the cinema.
Patrick: What did you see?
John: I saw a very good film by...

Sarah: Oh, you’ve broken your arm!
Rachel: Yes, I have. 
Sarah: How did it happen?
Rachel: It happened yesterday while I was riding my bike.

I do judo and I’ve won some competitions. In fact, I’ve won two medals. I got the first one in Singapore in 2002. The second one was different. It was in Tokyo and I was older.

Duration with how long, for and since: We use the present perfect with how long, for, since to talk about actions or situations that started in the past and still continue or are still true now.
We use the past simple with how long, for, since to talk about actions or situations that started and finished in the past. We can compare with this examples:
He‘s lived in New York for ten years. (=He lives in New York now)
He lived in New York for ten years. (=He does NOT live in New York now)
How long have you worked in the bank? (=You work in the bank now)
How long did you work in the bank? (=You do NOT work in the bank now)

Example

******* Past continuous and past simple

- Past continuous

- Form
            I / He / She / It     You / We / They
Positive    I was playing         You were playing
Negative    He wasn't playing     We weren't playing
Questions   Was she playing ?     Were they playing ?
Short       Yes, she was.         Yes, they were.
answers     No, she wasn't.       No, they weren't

- Use

- Actions in progress: We use the past continuous to talk about actions that were in progress (not finished) at a specific moment in the past.
Examples
‘What were you doing at 9?’ ‘I was studying.’
When I saw them yesterday, they were arguing.

- The specific moment in the past can be described by a time expression  (at 9 a.m., at midday, at lunchtime, all morning, all day, etc.).
Examples
They were swimming at 7 in the morning.
At midday they were still working.
-- Or by a simple past sentence.
Examples
They were swimming when I saw them.
When she arrived, they were still working.

- Describing a scene: We often use the past continuous at the beginning of a story to describe the situation.
Example
It was getting dark, and I was walking fast. Suddenly ...

- Past simple vs past continuous: We use the past simple for completed actions in the past, and we use the past continuous for actions in progress (not finished) in the past.
Examples
We ate out yesterday. (the action is finished)
We were eating at 9. (the action was not finished)
-- The past continuous describes a longer action or situation and the past simple describes a shorter action or event.
Examples
When I met Susan she was having a drink at a terrace with a friend. 
We didn’t go out because it was raining. 
-- The short action in past simple often interrupts the longer action in past continuous.
Examples
He was playing football when he broke her arm. 
When I went to bed, it was raining. 
-- We use the past simple for completed actions that happened one after the other.
Compare:
When he arrived, she was having a shower.
(The action of having a shower started before he arrived)
When he arrived, she had a shower.
(The action of having a shower started after he arrived)

******* Past perfect

- Form: had (not) + past participle (-ed / 3rd column)

Positive       He had seen the film before
               He'd seen the film before
Negative       They had not seen the film before
               They hadn't seen the film before
Questions      Had you seen the film before ?
Short answer   Yes, I had.
               No, I hadn't.

Notes:
- The past perfect is the same for all persons.
Example
I/you/he/she/it/we/they had left when I arrived
- We can contract had to ‘d.
Example
I called him, but he’d gone to a meeting. 

- Use

- We use the past perfect when we are talking about the past and then we want to talk about something that happened earlier in the past.
Examples
When I got out of work I saw that somebody had stolen my car. 
Yesterday my mother told me that she had seen you in the park.

- Past perfect or past simple?: We use the past simple to describe a series of past event in chronological order, and we use the past perfect to make clear that one of the events happened before.
Compare these two sentences:
When I arrived, she left. (=She left after I arrived.)
When I arrived, she had left. (She left before I arrived)

- Be careful with this common mistake!: The contraction ‘d can be had or would. Remember that we use an infinitive form after would and a past participle after had.
Examples
I‘d love to go to your party. (= would)
I noticed that he‘d eaten my cake. (= had)

------> Future <------

******* will vs be going to – future

- Form
                will + infinitive      be going to + infinitive
Positive        I will play            I'm going to play
Negative        I won't play           I'm not going to play
Questions       Will you play ?        Are you going to play ?
Short answer    Yes, I will            Yes, I am
                No, I won't            No, I'm not

- Use

- Predictions
-- Will: Use will to talk about something that you think will happen.
Examples
I think he’ll win the election.
He will be a good doctor.
-- Be going to: Use be going to to talk about something that you see is going to happen (there is present evidence).
Examples
Don’t drive like a crazy man. We’re going to have an accident!
The doctor said I’m going to have a girl.
-- Sometimes there’s little difference between will and be going to for predictions.
-- Compare:
The conference starts in 10 minutes. We are going to be late. (=I can see that we cannot be at the conference in 10 minutes)
We need to hurry up. We’ll be late for the conference. (=I think we will be late)

- Decisions
-- Will: Use will for decisions that you take at the moment of speaking (instant decisions).
Example
‘Oh, we don’t have sugar.’ ‘Don’t worry, I’ll buy some.’
-- Be going to: Use be going to for decisions that you have already taken at the moment of speaking (intentions or plans).
Example
‘Why are you undressing?’ ‘Because I’m going to go for a swim.’
-- Compare:
‘Sarah said she needs to talk to you.’ ‘Oh, I didn’t know. I’ll call her in a minute.’ (=I took the decision while having this conversation.)
‘Sarah said she needs to talk to you.’ ‘Yes, I know. I’m going to call her in a minute.‘ (=I took the decision before having this conversation.)

******* Present continuous for future arrangements

- We often use the present continuous to talk about the future, especially about future plans when we have decided a time and a place with other people. We normally use a future time expression, e.g. tomorrow, next week, at 7, etc.
Examples
I’m meeting Sally at 7. (=I have talked to her and we have arranged to meet.)
I’m flying to New York tomorrow morning. (=I have the ticket.)
We’re getting married next July. (=We have decided it and we have probably already made reservations for the restaurant, etc.)

- The present continuous for future arrangements is very common with verbs of travelling, and when we are meeting people.
Examples
I’m leaving very early tomorrow. I’m taking the 7.30 train. 
I’m playing golf with Jack next Saturday. Would you like to come?
I’m seeing the dentist after class.

- Present continuous vs be going to

-- We can normally use the present continuous or "be going to" to talk about future plans.
Examples
I’m leaving very early tomorrow.
I’m going to leave very early tomorrow.

-- But we prefer using the present continuous when we have made arrangements (i.e. decided a place an time with somebody else). When use "be going to", we put the emphasis on our intention to do something.
Examples
I’m going to study for the exams tomorrow. (=it’s my intention)
I’m leaving at 8 tomorrow. (=it’s an arrangement)
‘Your car is dirty.’ ‘I know. I’m going to wash it tomorrow.’ (=it’s my intention, but I haven’t arranged to do it)

- will for decisions: Use "will" for decisions that you take at the moment of speaking (instant decisions).
Example
‘Oh, we don’t have sugar.’ ‘Don’t worry, I’ll buy some.’

- "be going to" or "will" for predictions: We use "be going to" or "will" (NOT present continuous) to make predictions about the future. (⇒ See Grammar points » A2 Grammar » Will vs be going to – Future)
Examples
I think he’ll win the election.
The doctor said I’m going to have a girl.

I must get up early tomorrow.

-- Don't have to
Don’t need to - not necessary: If you don’t have to do something, it means that you ‘don’t need to’ do something (there is no obligation). You can do it but you don’t need to do it if you don’t want to do it.
Example

-- Mustn’t
Prohibition: Use mustn’t to talk about something that you can’t do. It’s necessary that you don’t do it.
Examples

---- Obligation from the speaker: We normally use must when to talk about obligations that come from the opinion of the speaker. The speaker thinks it’s necessary or important to do something.
Examples
MANAGER: You must get up early tomorrow. The meeting is at nine.(=The obligation comes from the manager. The manager thinks it’s necessary.)
DOCTOR: You must stop smoking. (=It’s the doctor’s opinion. The doctor thinks it’s necessary.)
SMOKER: I must stop smoking. (=It’s the smoker’s opinion. The smoker thinks it’s necessary to stop smoking.)

Examples
WORKER: We have to get up early tomorrow. The meeting is at nine. (=The obligation comes from the manager, not from the worker.)
SMOKER: I have to stop smoking. (=It’s the doctor’s opinion, not the smoker’s opinion. The doctor thinks it’s necessary.)

- Comparison between MUSTN'T vs DON'T HAVE TO

-- Don't have to

-- Mustn't

Notes:
-- That in a negative sentence, we often say I don’t think ... should ... (NOT I think ... shouldn’t ...)
Example
I don’t think you should call her now; she’s very upset. (NOT I think you shouldn’t call her)
-- We often say Do you think ... should ... to ask for advice.
Example
Do you think I should look for another apartment?

- Ought to, ought not to: We can also use ought to instead of should, and ought not to instead of shouldn’t.
Examples
You ought to have some rest.
He ought not to drive so fast.

******* might, might not – possibility

- Might (not) = Maybe it is (not) true: We use might, might not when we think something is (not) or will (not) be true, but we aren’t sure.
Examples
‘Suzan isn’t answering the phone.’ ‘She might be in the garden.’
The sky is clearing up. It might not rain this afternoon. 
They might win the competition. 

- I might (not) = It is possible that I will (not)
-- We say that someone might do something to mean that ‘it is possible that someone will do something‘.
Examples
I might go for a run this afternoon. (=It’s possible that I will go for a run.)
She might come to the conference.
-- We say that someone might not do something to mean that ‘it is possible that someone won’t do something‘.
Examples
I might not come to the party. (=It’s possible that I won’t come to the party.)
He might not go to work tomorrow. 

- May, may not
 
-- may = might: We can use may and may not instead of might and might not.
Examples
She may be late for class this morning. 
They may not like your decision. 

-- May I ... ?: We don’t often use might or may in questions. However, we can use may I in questions to ask for permission.
Examples
May I sit here? (=Can I sit here?)
May I come in?

******* used to, didn’t use to – past habits and states

- Form

Positive
He used to play football.

Negative
He didn't use to play football

Questions
Did he use to play football ?

Short answers
Yes, he did.
No, he didn't.

Notes:
"Used to" is only past (NOT use to)
"Usually" is used for present habits.

- Use

-- Past habits, repeated actions: We use used to for past habits or things that happened repeatedly in the past, but they don’t happen any more.
Examples
When I was a teenager, I used to go dancing every weekend.
Every Sunday after lunch, we used to play in the street.
I used to play chess every day, but now I don’t play very often.
When the economy was better, we used to eat out every week.

-- Past states - no longer true: We use used to with non-action verbs (be, have, etc.) for past states: things that were true in the past, but they are not true any more.
Example
I used to be blonde when I was a child.
She used to be very shy when she was a child.
I used to like her music, but now I hate it.

-- Didn’t use to, did you use to?: We use "did/didn’t" + "use to" for negatives and questions.
Examples
He didn't use to travel a lot.
"Did he use to live here?" "Yes, he did."
-- We can also use NEVER for negatives
Example
We never used to argue.

- Past simple vs Used to

-- Past simple + always, usually, often, etc.: We can also use the past simple tense + frequency adverbs for past habits.
Examples
I always met her at the bar down the street. (= I used to meet ...)
I usually had a big salad for dinner. (= I used to have ...)

-- Past simple (NOT used to): But we use the past simple (NOT used to) for actions that happened once or when we mention when they happened.
Examples
Last week I met her at the bar down the street. (NOT I used to meet ...)
I had a big salad for dinner last Sunday. (NOT I used to have ...)

- Usually or used to?
 
-- "Used to" is only used in the past. For present habits, we must use the present simple tense with "usually" or "normally".
Examples
I usually get up very early at weekends. (NOT I use to get up ...)
We don't usually play on Sunday. (NOT We don't use to play)

------> Conditionals, if, wish, etc. <------

******* First conditional and future time clauses

- First conditional

If clause      comma      main clause         examples
(condition)               (result)
                          will                If you call him, he'll be happy.
                          imperative          If you have time, call him.
If {present}   ,          should              If you have time, you should call him.
                          could, can          If we go out, we can go to the movies.
                          must                If you know the truth, you must tell me.
                          might               If you run so fast, you might fall.

Notes:
- All conditional sentences have two parts: the if clause and the main clause. It doesn’t matter which clause comes first, but when the if clause  comes first, we should put a comma after it.
Examples
If it rains, we’ll stay home
We’ll stay home if it rains.

- The if clause may have a present or a future meaning, but the verb is always in present (NOT future)
Example
If you are a good boy tomorrow, mummy will buy you a present. (NOT If you will be a good boy)

- Future time clauses

Time clause             comma      main clause     Examples
When                               will            When I'm 69, I'll retire.
As soon as                         imperative      As soon as you arrive, call me.
Until                              should          When you have time, you should call him.
Once        present     ,          could, can      Until you all finish, nobody can leave.
Before                             must            Before you come, you must call me.
After                              might           When she arrives, she might be shocked.
While

Notes
-- Similar: Future time clauses are similar to the first conditional. There’s a main clause and a when/after/etc. clause. We use the verbs in these clauses like in the first conditional.
-- Comma: We use a comma when the when/after/etc. clause is at the beginning of the sentence. But we don’t use a comma if the when/after/etc. clause is at the end of the sentence.
Examples
I’ll retire when I’m 70. 
When I’m 70, I’ll retire. 
-- Structure: We use PRESENT in the when/after/etc. clause and we use FUTURE in the main clause.
Example
Before you go to sleep, daddy will tell you a story. 

******* Second conditional

If clause      comma      main clause        examples
(condition)               (result)
If {past}      ,          would              If we were together, we would be happier.
If {past}      ,          could              If I had a better salary, I could travel more.

- Use

-- We use if + past to talk about an imaginary present or future situation (although the verb is in past, the meaning is present or future). And we use would + infinitive to talk about the result or consequence of that imaginary situation.
Examples
If we had a mansion in the country, we’d go there every weekend. 
Would you travel around the world if you won the lottery?

-- Comma: When the if clause comes first, we normally put a comma after it. We don’t use a comma when the main clause comes first and the if clause comes second.
Examples
If I won the lottery, I’d buy a mansion.
I’d buy a mansion if I won the lottery. 

-- Would: form

Would/wouldn’t is the same for all persons.
I/you/he/she/it/we/they would/wouldn’t do that if it was possible.
Contracted forms are wouldn’t = would not and ‘d = would
Examples
I‘d never tell anyone if you told me your secret. 
I wouldn’t tell anyone if you told me your secret. 

-- Could

We can often use could + infinitive instead of would + infinitive in the main clause.
Example
If you spoke English, you could get a better job.

-- Was or were?
 
In the second conditional we can use if I/he/she/it were (more formal) instead of if I/he/she/it was.
Examples
If I were/was fit, I would run a marathon.
We wouldn’t have any problems if he were/was  more reasonable.

But we use were (NOT was) when we give advice with the expression if I were you.
Examples
If I were you, I would stay home and rest.
I wouldn’t pay any attention to what he says if I were you.

- First conditional vs second conditional

First conditional     Example (=Maybe I will find her; it's possible)
(possible)
If {present}, will    If I find her, I'll tell her that I love her.

Second conditional    Example (=I will not find her, it's improbable)
If {past}, would      If I found her, I'd tell her that I love her.

-- Use: We use the first conditional to talk about possible future situations and we use the second conditional to talk about hypothetical or imaginary future situations.
Examples
If I don’t have a meeting tomorrow morning, I’ll have lunch with you. (It’s possible. Maybe I don’t have a meeting.)
If I didn’t have a meeting tomorrow morning, I’d have lunch with you. (It’s hypothetical. I have a meeting tomorrow, so I won’t be able to have lunch with you.)

------> Passive <------

******* Present and past simple passive: be + past participle

- Form

-- Present and past simple passive
           Verb to be              Past participle (-ed/3rd column)
Present simple: am/is/are (not) +  Invented, Done, Produced, Seen
Past simple: was/were (not)     +  Produced, Seen

-- Questions
Question word     be      subject          past participle
How often         is      the classroom    cleaned ?
When              was     the classroom    cleaned ?

- Active sentences vs passive sentences

When A does B, we have two possible ways of talking about it: active or passive. In active sentences A is the subject (before the verb). In passive sentences B is the subject. Check the following examples:
 
-- Present simple

Examples:
Somebody cleans the classroom every day. (Active)
The classroom is cleaned every day. (Passive)

-- Past simple

Examples:
Somebody cleaned the classroom yesterday. (Active)
The classroom was cleaned yesterday. (Passive)

As you can see, the object of an active sentence is the subject of a passive sentence. In an active sentence, the subject is the ‘doer’ of the action and the object is the ‘receiver’ of the action. And in a passive sentence, the subject is the receiver of the action, NOT the doer. Compare:

A) Somebody broke the window.
B) The window was broken (by someone).
In sentence A, ‘somebody’ is the doer of the breaking, and in sentence B, ‘the window’ is the receiver of the breaking.

- When do we use the passive?
 
The passive is more formal than the active and it is more common in written language. We often use the passive when we don’t know, when it is obvious, or when we don’t want so say who or what is responsible for the action.
Examples
A bank was robbed yesterday. (We don’t know who robbed the bank.)
The robber was arrested last night. (It’s obvious that the police arrested the robber.)
I was told that you insulted my brother. (I don’t want to say who told me.)
Jurassic Park was filmed by Spielberg in 1993. (I’m talking about Jurassic Park and not about Spielberg.)

- Passive voice + by
 
We can use by to say who or what is responsible for the action.
Examples
The painting was bought by a very rich American.
Penicillin was invented by Alexander Fleming. 

------> Reported speech <------

******* Reported speech – indirect speech

- What is reported speech or indirect speech?
 
When we tell people what another person said or thought, we often use reported speech or indirect speech. To do that, we need to change verb tenses (present, past, etc.) and pronouns (I, you, my, your, etc.) if the time and speaker are different.
Examples
Sally: ‘I don’t have time.’ ⇒ Sally said that she didn’t have time. 
Peter: ‘I am tired .’ ⇒ He said that he was tired. 

- Omission of that
 
We often leave out that after reporting verbs like say, think, etc. 
Examples
She said she was late. (= She said that she was late.)
I thought I would get the job.

- Say or tell?
 
The most common verbs we use in reported speech are say and tell. We must pay attention here. We say tell somebody something, and say something (to somebody).
Examples
They told me (that) they would help me. (NOT They said me they would help me.)
He said (that) he didn’t have a car. (NOT He told that he didn’t have a car.)

- Tense changes in reported speech
 
When a person said something in the past and now we tell somebody what that person said, the time is different, and for this reason, the verb tenses change. Look at a summary of these changes.

Verb tense   Direct speech               Verb tense   Indirect speech
Present      "I am exhausted"            Past         "He said (that) he was exhausted."
simple                                   simple
Present      "I'm studying."             Past         "She told me (that) she was studying."
continuous                               continuous
Past         "I loved the concert"       Past         "He told me (that) he had loved the concert"
simple                                   perfect
Present      "I have never been to Rome" Past         "She said (that) she'd never been to Rome"
perfect                                  perfect
Will         "I will help you"           Would        "He said (that) he would help me"
Must         "You must pay attention"    Had to       "She told me (that) I had to pay attention"

- Pronoun changes in reported speech
 
In reported or indirect speech we must also pay attention to the use of pronouns. When a person tells us something, he or she uses the first person (I, me, my, we, us, our) to talk about himself or herself and the second person (you, your) to talk about us, the person listening. But when we tell someone else what that person said, we are going to use the third person (he, she, his, her, etc.) to talk about the speaker and the first person (I, me, my) to talk about ourselves, the listener.
Examples
‘I will help you.’ ⇒ He said that HE would help ME.
‘That’s my pen.’ ⇒ She said that it was HER pen.
‘I need your help.’ ⇒ She said that SHE needed MY help.

------> -ing and the infinitive <------

******* Expressing purpose with ‘to’ and ‘for’

- Use: We can use "to" + infinitive and "for" + noun to say what is the purpose of an action, or the reason why we do something.

-- to + infinitive
Examples
I went to the grocery store to buy some vegetables. 
I studied hard to pass the exam.

-- for + noun
Examples
Let’s go to the pub for a drink. 
We climbed to the top for the views.

-- Compare to vs for
Examples
I went to the shop to buy some milk.
I went to the shop for some milk.

- for + -ing

-- We don’t use for + -ing to say what is the purpose of our actions, why we do something.
Examples
I work hard for improving my English. BAD!
I work hard to improve my English. GOOD!
Turn the TV on for watching the news. BAD!
Turn the TV on to watch the news. GOOD!

-- We use for + ing to talk about the purpose or function of a thing, what an object is used for.
Examples
This machine is used for cleaning cars.
This is a special camera for photographing small objects.

******* Infinitives and gerunds – verb patterns

- Gerund (-ing)

-- Use 1: When the verb is the subject of a sentence.
Example
Reading on tablets and phones isn’t very good for your eyes.

-- Use 2: After a preposition.
Example
I'm tired of waiting. Let’s go home.

-- Use 3: After some verbs.
Examples
I don’t mind waiting.
She recommended visiting this museum.

-- Common verbs followed by a gerund: Some common verbs that are followed by gerund are: avoid, enjoy, finish, hate, keep, like, love, don’t mind, prefer, recommend, spend time, stop, suggest, etc.

-- Negative gerund: The negative form of the gerund is not + -ing.
Example
He enjoys not having to wake up early at weekends.

- Infinitive WITHOUT "to"

-- Use 1: After the auxiliary verb "do", "does", "did" in negative sentences and questions.
Examples
He didn’t say anything.
Does Tim work with you?
I don’t believe you.

-- Use 2: After modal verbs (will, can, must, should, might, may, etc.).
Examples
You should come with us.
I can’t play the guitar.

- Infinitive WITH to

-- Use 1: After adjectives.
Example
It’s important to arrive early at the station.

-- Use 2: To express a reason or purpose (why).
Examples
I went to Madrid to visit some family.
I need time to study for the exam.

-- Use 3: After question words.
Examples
I don’t know what to eat.
I want to learn how to play the guitar.

-- Use 4: After some verbs.
Examples

She seems to be distracted.

-- Some common verbs that are followed by "to" infinitive are: decide, forget, help, hope, learn, need, offer, plan, promise, remember, seem, try, want, would like, would love, would hate, would prefer, etc.

-- The negative form of to + infinitive is not to + infinitive.
Example
She decided not to enter the competition.

******* much, many, little, few, some, any – quantifiers

- Summary
          Countable     Uncountable
Large       A lot of / Lots of        (positive)
quantity   Many             Much      (negative, questions)

Small      (a) few      (a) little
quantity                 A bit of
                   Some               (positive)
                   Any                (negative, questions)

- SOME / ANY
                   
-- Use "some" in positive sentences
Example
I have some questions for you
-- Use "any" in negative and questions
Examples
Is there any sugar in the jar?
We didn't have any problems.
Have you got any new friends?
-- We use "some" (NOT "any") in interrogative sentences when we are offering or requesting (= asking for) something.
Examples
Would you like some tea ?
Can I have some tea ?
-- Both some and any can be used before countable and uncountable nouns. If we use them before a countable noun, the noun must be in plural form.
Example
Are there any students in the classroom? (NOT Is there any student in the classroom?)

- A LOT OF / LOTS OF

-- Use "a lot of" or "lots of" (more informal) + noun in positive sentences.
Example
He spend a lot of time watching TV.
We had lots of good moments together.
-- We must always use "a lot of" or "lots of" including "of" before a NOUN. However, we can use "a lot/lots" (without "of") at the end of a sentence.
Examples
‘How many beers did you have?’ ‘I don’t know; I had lots/a lot.’
They made cookies and I had lots/a lot.
I like her a lot.

- MANY / MUCH

-- Use "many/much" in negative and questions.
Examples
There isn't much coffee.
Did they invite many people ?
-- But you can use "too many/much" in positive.
Example
There is too much salt in the soup.
You eat too many biscuits.
-- "how many/much" to ask about quantity.
Example
How many children do you have ?
How much coffee have you had today ?

- FEW/LITTLE vs A FEW/A LITTLE

-- Few / little: almost none; not enough.
Examples
There's little milk in the fridge. We need to buy more.
A: "Do you speak English?" B: "No, sorry. I speak very little English."

-- A few / a little / a bit of: not a lot, but enough.
Examples
A: "Shall I buy some more beers?" B: "No, it's OK. There are a few in the fridge."
A: "Do you speak English?" B: "Yes, I speak a little English".
I have to do a few things this afternoon.
He always gets good results with very little effort.
Can you put a bit of sugar in the tea?

-- Normally, the difference between a few/little (WITH a) and few/little (WITHOUT a) is that a few/little is positive in meaning, and few/little is negative.
Examples
There’s little milk in the fridge; we have to buy more. (Not enough; we need more)
‘Shall I buy some beers?’ ‘No, it’s OK, there are a few in the fridge.’ (= Enough; we don’t need more)
‘Do you speak English?’ ‘No, I speak very little English.’ (= Negative)
‘Do you speak English?’ ‘Yes, I speak a little English.’ (= Positive)

------> Relative clauses, relative pronouns and adverbs <------

******* Defining relative clauses – who, which, that, where

- Use: We use defining relative clauses to specify which person, thing or place we are talking about.

- Who
-- Use: We use who for people.
Example
He met the police officer who saved his life.

- Which
-- Use: We use which for things and animals.
Example
He put on the suit which he wore for special occasions.

- Where
-- Use: We use where for places.
Example
This is the hotel where we spend our honeymoon.

- That
-- Use: We can use "that" instead of "who" or "which". But we often use "who" for people and "which/that" for things.
Examples
He’s the neighbour who/that helped us to move out.
Change the cable which/that connects the computer to the printer.

- Common mistakes: We cannot use "what" or an expression like *that he/she etc. in this type of relative clauses.
Examples
That’s the student that/who I told you about. (NOT the student what I told you about)
That’s the man that/who tried to steal my wallet. (NOT the man that he tried to steal my wallet.)

------> Auxiliary verbs <------

******* so, neither – so am I, neither do I, etc.

- So, neither

-- Use: To say that A is or does the same as B, we can use...
so + auxiliary verb + subject for affirmative sentences
neither + auxiliary verb + subject for negative sentences.
Examples
A: “I am from London.”  B: “So am I.” (=I am from London too.)
A: “I’m not tired.”  B: “Neither am I.” (=I am not tired either.)
 
-- Same verb: After so/neither we use the SAME auxiliary or modal verb as in the first sentence: be, do, have, can, will, must, etc. See the equivalences that are below.
Examples
A: “Tomas is not going to the party.”  B: “Neither is Sally.”
A: “I’ll be here at 7.”  B: “So will I.”
A: “Lisa can play the guitar.”  B: “So can Tim.”

-- When there isn’t an auxiliary or modal verb in the first sentence, we use DO/DOES for present and DID for past.
Examples
A: “I want to leave.”  B: “So do I.”
A: “George loves chocolate.”  B: “So does Bruno.”
A: “I went to bed very late.”  B: “So did I.”
 
-- Nor = neither: We can use NOR instead of NEITHER.
Example
A: “I wasn’t ready.”  B: “Nor/Neither was I.”
 
-- Common mistake: "neither/nor" is a negative word, like not. For this reason, the auxiliary verb after "neither" should be affirmative.
Examples
A: “I didn’t see the film yesterday.”  B: “Neither did I.” (NOT Neither didn’t I)
A: “Ray couldn’t answer the question.”  B: “Neither could Jimmy.” (NOT Neither couldn’t Jimmy.)

- Too, either

-- Use: Another way of saying that A is or does the same as B, is the use of "too" or "either" at the END of the sentence. We use "too" for affirmative sentences and "either" for negative sentences.
Examples
A: “I want to leave.”  B: “I want to leave too.”
A: “I didn’t go.”  B: “I didn’t go either.”

- Equivalences between "so" and "too"

A: "I am tired" B: "So am I" = I am tired too
A: "I like studying" B: "So do I" = I like studying too
A: "John loves music" B: "So does Mary" = John loves music too
A: "I was at home all morning" B: "So was I" = I was at home all morning too
A: "You were late" B: "So were you" = You were late too
A: "I went to bed very late" B: "So did I" = I went to bed very late too
A: "Sally has found a job" B: "So has Rachel" = Sally has found a job too
A: "I will be late for class" B: "So will I" = I will be late for class too
A: "Tom can speak French" B: "So can Mary" = Tom can speak French too.
A: "You should go home" B: "So should you" = You should go home too.

- Equivalences between "neither" and "either"

A: "I am not tired" B: "Neither am I" = I am not tired either
A: "I don't like studying" B: "Neither do I" = I don't like studying either
A: "John doesn't like rice" B: "Neither does Tim" = John doesn't like rice either
A: "I wasn't ready" B: "Neither was I" = I wasn't ready either.
A: "You weren't the best" B: "Neither were you" = You weren't the best either
A: "I didn't go to bed late" B: "Neither did I" = I didn't go to bed late either
A: "Sally hasn't called yet" B: "Neither has Bill" = Bill hasn't called either
A: "I won't be at the office" B: "Neither will I" = I won't be at the office either
A: "Tom can't speak French" B: "Neither can Mary" = Tom can't speak French either

------> Adjectives and adverbs <------

******* Comparative and superlative adjectives and adverbs

- Spelling
Adjetive     Comparative     Spelling rule

bad          worse           Irregular adjetive

- Comparative

- Use: We use the COMPARATIVE form of an adjective to compare two things.
Examples
White meat is healthier than red meat.
Travelling by bus is more comfortable than travelling by train.

- Less: When comparing two things, we can also use the form "less" + adjective + "than" (less ≠ more).
Example
Peter is less considerate than Marta. (= Marta is more considerate)

- as .. as: We can also use the form (not) "as" + adjective + "as".
Example
Peter isn’t as considerate as Marta. (= Marta is more considerate)

- After "than" or "as ... as" we can use an object pronoun (me, you, him, etc.), or we can also use a subject pronoun (I, you, he, etc.) + verb.
Example
My sister is taller than me. = My sister is taller than I am.
His sister is more intelligent than him. = His sister is more intelligent than he is.

- Before the comparative (more or –er) we can use much, a lot or a bit.
Examples
He’s a bit taller than me.
Florence is much more interesting than Pisa.
My car is a lot more expensive than yours.

- Superlatives

- Use: When we compare three or more things, we use the SUPERLATIVE form of the adjectives.
Compare:
Both John and his brother play football, but John is better. 
John and his two brothers all play football, but John is the best.

- Use of "in": after the superlative we use "in" before names of places or before singular words referring to groups of people (class, school, team, family, etc.)
Examples
The Everest is the highest mountain in the world. (NOT of the world)
She is the best student in the class.
He’s the tallest in the family.

- We often use a superlative adjective with the present perfect tense of a verb and the word "ever".
Examples
This is the best movie I’ve ever watched.
She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.

- the / my / John’s: Before the superlative we always use "the" or a possessive adjective (my, your, his, etc.) or noun (Paul’s, Elisabeth’s, etc.)
Examples
He is the best.
This is my most expensive jacket.
This is Paul’s best friend.

------> Conjunctions and clauses <------

******* however, although, because, so, and time connectors

- Topic 1: Contrast

- However
-- Use: it means ‘but’. "However" is normally used at the beginning of a sentence, before a comma (,) and after a full stop (.) or a semicolon (;).
Examples
We didn’t like the hotel. However, he had a good time.
I would like to have a dog; however, my husband is allergic to dogs. 

- Although
-- Use: "although" means ‘despite the fact that’, or ‘but’ ("a pesar de.." o "pese a que.."). Although can be used at the beginning or in the middle of a sentence. We do NOT use a comma after although; we use although + subject + verb.
Examples
Although he had a bad leg, he still won the game.
I passed the exam, although I hadn’t studied.

- Topic 2: Reason

- Because
-- Use: We use "because" + subject + verb.
Examples
We had to cancel the concert because it was raining.
I didn’t call you because I didn’t want to worry you.
 
- Because of ("debido a ...")
-- Use: We use because of + noun
Examples
We had to cancel the concert because of the rain.
Many shops had to close because of the economic situation. 

- Topic 3: Result

- So
-- Use: "So" is the most common connector to express result. It is normally used in the middle of a sentence after (,).
Examples
We worked hard all morning, so I am very tired now. 
The TV is very expensive, so I don’t think I’ll buy it. 

- Topic 4: Time

- Before
-- Use: We can use "before" + noun / -ing verb, or we can use "before" + subject + verb.
Examples
Before I have breakfast, I read a few pages. 
Before having breakfast, I read a few pages. 
Before breakfast, I read a few pages.

- After
-- Use 1: We can use "after" + noun / -ing verb, or we can use "after" + subject + verb.
Example
I smoke a cigarette after dinner / having dinner/ I have dinner.
-- Use 2: When we are talking about consecutive actions, we can use "then" or "after that", but we cannot use "after".
Example
I got up and had a shower. Then/After that, I made breakfast. (NOT After, I made breakfast).

- While
-- Use: We use while + subject + verb to talk about actions happening at the same time, simultaneously.
Example
I read the newspaper while I was waiting.

- As soon as, when, once
"As soon as", "when", and "once" have a similar meaning. As soon as means ‘immediately when’.
Example
As soon as/when/once I get home, I’ll finish my homework.
-- Use: We use present simple, and NOT will to express future after as soon as, when, and once.
Example
When I get home, I’ll call you. (NOT when I will get home)
-- Use: We use a comma after the first part of the sentence when we start with before, after, while, as soon as, etc. But we do not use a comma if we use before, after, while, as soon as, etc in the second part of the sentence.
Examples
Before I go to bed, I brush my teeth. 
I brush my teeth before I go to bed. 

------> Prepositions <------

******* Prepositions of movement – along, across, over, etc.

- Use: We use prepositions after verbs to describe the direction of movement. It’s common to use these prepositions after verbs that describe movement (walk, run, come, go, drive, cycle, fly, etc.), although it is also possible to use them after other types of verbs (We talked over the fence, I looked into the room, etc.) or after nouns (the path to the beach, the road from Leeds, the way up the hill, etc.).

- To (Unlike "Towards", it describes destination, not direction)
->(·)
Examples
I took them to the beach.
I'd like to go to the cinema.

- From
(·)->
Examples
She comes from Japan.
I ran from home to the gym.

- Get on/off the bus or train, get into/out of the car
We say "get in" and "get out of" for a car, taxi, or van, but we say "get on" or "get off" for motorbikes and bicycles and for public means of transport, such as a bus, a train or a plane.
Examples
I have to get off the bus at the next stop. 
He stopped and got out of the car.

- When we want to talk about how we go from place A to place B, we can do it in two different ways:
1. Using "by" + means of transport (car, taxi, plane, bike, etc.) or using "on foot".
Examples
I go to school on foot. 
I go to work by car.
I went to Zurich by plane. 
I went to the airport by taxi. 
2. Using a verb of movement (walk, drive, fly, cycle, etc.) or for public transport, using "take" + means of transport.
Examples
I walk to school
I drive to work. 
I flew to Zurich. 
I took a taxi/a bus/a train/etc. to the airport. 

------> Questions <------

******* Asking questions in English – Question forms

- Word order in questions (to be and present simple)
Question word   Auxiliary verb    Subject    Main verb
                Do                you        like pizza?
What time       does              he         get up?
How much        did               you        pay for it?
Where           is                she        working?
What car        have              you        got?

- Word order in questions with be
Question word   Auxiliary verb    Subject    Main verb
                Is                Sharon     from the US?
How old         are               you?
Where           were              you        yesterday?
When            was               she        born?

- Questions in general: the order in questions is QWASM: Question word, Auxiliary verb, Subject, Main verb. In Yes-No questions (questions where the answer is yes or no), there is no Question Word.

- Questions with be as the main verb: when be is the main verb, it is used as the Auxiliary in the question, and then we don’t have a Main verb after the Subject.

- Auxiliary verbs (the verb "have" is different)
-- In the position of Auxiliary, we can use "be", "do", "have" or any modal verb: "can", "could", "will", "would", "should", etc.
"Have" is only an auxiliary verb in the form "have got" and in the present perfect.
Examples
Have you got any brothers or sisters?
What have you cooked for lunch?
-- For other uses of "have", we need an auxiliary verb (do, did) for questions.
Examples
What time did you have dinner yesterday? (NOT had you dinner)
Do you have to do it now? (NOT Have you to do it)
-- "Have got" only has a present form. It does not have a past form.
Example
Did you have many toys when you were a child? (NOT Had you got many toys when you were a child?)

- Question words

-- Person: Who
Example
A: Who's that man?
B: That's Peter.

-- Place: Where
Example
A: Where do you live?
B: In London.

-- Time: When
Example
A: When did he arrive?
B: In the afternoon.

-- Reason: Why
Example
A: Why did you leave?
B: Because I was tired.

-- Manner: How
Example
A: How did you go?
B: By car.

-- Object / idea / action: What
Example
A: What are you doing?
B: Nothing

-- Choice: Which
Example
A: Which car is better?
B: The red one.

-- Possession: Whose
Example
A: Whose book is this?
B: It's mine

-- Time: What time
Example
A: What time did he call?
B: At seven

-- Description: What kind
Example
A: What kind of car is it?
B: A hybrid

-- Quantity-countable: How many
Example
A: How many beds are there?
B: Three

-- Quantity-uncountable: How much
Example
A: How much tea is there?
B: A lot.

-- Duration / lenght: How long
Example
A: How long did you stay?
B: Two weeks

-- Frequency: How long
Example
A: How often do you go?
B: Every day

-- Distance: How far
Example
A: How far is the town? 
B: One mile away

-- Age: How old
Example
A: How old is your sister?
B: She's 27.

- Notes:

-- How much: We can use "how much" to ask about the price of something.
Example
How much is the jacket?

-- "How" + adjective: We can use "how" + adjective (any adjective) as a question word.
Example
How tall are you?
How fast is your car?

-- Which vs what: We can use "which" + noun, and we can also use "what" + noun. We use "which" when there are a small number of possible answers. Look at the difference:
Which car do you like, the red or the blue? (there is a small number of possible answers)
‘What car have you got?’ ‘A Mercedes.’ (many possible answers)

******* Subject questions, questions with preposition

- Subject questions and object questions:

We use subject questions when we are asking about who, what, etc. did the action. We do not use an auxiliary verb after the question word if the question word (who, what, etc.) is the subject of the sentence.
Examples
Who won the match? (NOT Who did win … )
What happened last night? (NOT What did happen … )
How many people went to the party? (NOT How many people did go …)

- When we are asking about the object (after the verb) we use the normal order of the English question: auxiliary verb + subject. These types of questions are called object 
questions.

- In summary, object question vs subject question:
Jack called Teresa. (Teresa = object)
Who did Jack call? (Who = object)

Jack called Teresa. (Jack = subject)
Who called Teresa? (Who = subject)

- Questions with preposition

We use questions with preposition when we ask about an element of the sentence that comes after a preposition. In questions with preposition we put the preposition at the end of the question (after the verb, or the verb + object if there is an object).
Examples
I played tennis with John. ⇒ Who did you play tennis with? (NOT With who did you…)
I work for a multinational company ⇒  What company do you work for?
We usually talk about sports. ⇒ What do you usually talk about?
