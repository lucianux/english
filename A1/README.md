We use the present simple for habits o for permanent situations with time expressions like: always, never, often, sometimes, every day, once a month, twice a week, etc.

There are verbs that don’t describe actions. These verbs are called stative or non-action verbs, and we can use these verbs in present simple but NOT in present continuous. Some of these verbs are: be, have (=possess/own), like, love, hate, prefer, need, want, know, etc.
Examples

Have you got a car? = Do you have a car?

- Be careful with this common mistake!
The verb have got only has a present form (NOT past).

-- Negative

She was not   - She wasn't
It was not    - It wasn't

In summary, Was/were are the past forms of am/is/are. Present: am/is = past: was. Present: are = past: were.
Remember: the negative short forms of was not and were not are wasn’t and weren’t, but there are no short forms of was and were in affirmative sentences.
Examples:
Tom was tired, but Susan wasn’t very tired.
Paul and Tom were happy, but we weren’t happy.

- Expressions
We use was/were to talk about the past. We often use past expressions of time: yesterday, last night, last week, two months ago, etc.
Examples:
She was in Stuttgart last summer.
We were late to the party last night.

- Was/Were born
We use was/were in the expression was/were born. The expression be born is always past (NOT present): was/were born.
Examples
‘Where were you born?’ ‘I was born in Sweden.’ (NOT Where are you born? I am born...)
Mozart was born in 1756.

******* Past simple – regular/irregular verbs

--- Past simple REGULAR

We often add -ed to verbs (REGULAR verbs) to make the past simple.
Examples:

I live in Barcelona. ⇒ I lived in Barcelona in the 90s.

Spelling of regular verbs (based on rules)

------> -ing and the infinitive <------

******* Verbs + to + infinitive AND verbs + -ing

- Verbs + -ing
Some verbs in English are followed by another verb in the -ing form. The most common of these verbs are verbs of liking and disliking: love, like, enjoy, don’t mind, don’t like, hate. If we use another verb after these verbs, it often takes the -ing form.
Examples:
I love going to the gym. 
I like reading. 
I enjoy travelling. 
I don’t mind cooking. 
I don’t like doing homework. 
I hate getting up early.
Note:
The second verb is in the -ing form in the past too.
Examples:
When I was a child I hated going to school. (NOT I hated went to school.)

-ing spelling
You can check the spelling of the -ing form of the verbs in the table below.
Infinitive      -ing form      Spelling rule
work            working        in general => add -ing
study           studying       in general => add -ing
live            living         after consonant + -e => delete -e and add -ing
write           writing        after consonant + -e => delete -e and add -ing
run             running        consonant + vowel + consonant => double consonant + -ing
swim            swimming       consonant + vowel + consonant => double consonant + -ing
die             dying          after -ie => delete -ie and add -ying
lie             lying          after -ie => delete -ie and add -ying

- Verbs + to + infinitive
Many verbs in English are followed by to + infinitive. Some of these verbs are: forget, hope, learn, need, offer, plan, remember, start, want and would like.
Examples
I forgot to turn off the light. 
I hope to see you soon. 
I‘m learning to drive. 
We need to arrive early. 
She offered to help us. 
We are planning to go to France. 
Remember to lock the door. 
I want to go home. 
I would like to buy a new computer. 
The second verb takes the to + infinitive form in the past too.
Example
I wanted to go home. (NOT I wanted to went home.)

-- Would like
The verb would like (or ‘d like) is different from like. We use would like + to + infinitive and we normally use like + -ing verb to talk about general preference.
Examples:
I‘d like to study English. 
I like studying English. 
-- The meaning is also different.
Examples:
I‘d like to study English. (=I want to do it.)
I like studying English. (=I enjoy it.)

-- Present and past: The past form of there is, there are is there was, there were.
Examples
There is a car in the street. ⇒  There was a car in the street.
There are some cars in the street. ⇒  There were some cars in the street.
-- Short forms 1 / The short form of there is is there’s, but we don’t use a short form of there are. There’s is not used in short answers.
Examples
There’s a new secretary in the office.
There are two bathrooms in this house.  
-- Short forms 2 / There are no short forms for there was/there were.
-- In negative sentences, we often use the short forms there isn’t/there aren’t and there wasn’t/weren’t.
Examples
There isn’t any bread left. We need to buy more.
There aren’t any cookies in the jar.

******* There or it (comparison)

- There (We had already seen this topic before. Let's review)

-- We use "there" to say when or where something is.
Examples
There are some dirty cups on the table.
There is a party tomorrow.

-- We use "there" to say that something exists or is happening.
Examples
There is a problem. 
There was an accident.

Note: we use "there" the first time we mention something. If we talk about the same thing again, we use "it" or "they".
Examples
There are some cups on the table. But they are dirty.
There was an accident. It was horrible.

- It

- Use 1 / We use "it" (or "they") to talk about something again in the conversation.
Examples
There is a party tomorrow. It will be fantastic!
We saw a snake in the forest. It was very big.
There are some cups on the table. But they are dirty.

- Use 2 / We use "it" to talk about times and dates.

Let’s go home. It‘s very late. 
It‘s four o’clock.

- Use 3 / We use "it" to talk about the weather.

It‘s 2 kilometres from the hotel to the station. 
Note: we use far is negative sentences and questions and we use a long way in affirmative sentences.

- Use 5 / We use "it's" + adjective + "to" + infinitive.
Examples
It’s nice to see you again.
It was difficult to find the hotel.

------> Adjectives and adverbs <------

******* Adjectives

- Form

-- Adjective + noun
When we use adjectives with a noun in English, the adjectives go before the noun.
Examples
It’s an expensive guitar. (NOT It’s a guitar expensive.)
She has a new car.

-- am/is/are + adjective
We can also use adjectives without a noun after the verb be.
Examples
This guitar is expensive.
Her car is new.

-- In questions the adjective can go after "be" + subject.
Examples
Is your car new?
Are your classmates nice?

-- feel/look/smell/sound/taste + adjective / We can also use adjectives without a noun after the verbs of the senses: feel, look, smell, sound, taste.
Examples
Your idea sounds interesting. 
I don’t like this soup. It tastes horrible.
You look tired. 
These cookies smell delicious. 
I feel depressed. 

-- Very/quite: We can use very and quite before the adjectives.
Examples
It’s very expensive.
It’s quite expensive.

******* Adverbs of manner (slowly) – or adjectives (slow)?

late              late
right             right
wrong             wrong

- Adverbs of manner - Use

- Use 1 / We use adverbs of manner after a verb to describe the verb. We use an adverb of manner to say how something happens or how we do something.
Examples
It rained heavily. (=We are describing how it rained.)
He always replies quickly. (=We are describing how he walks)

- Adverbs of manner - Position

- Use 1 / We use adverbs of manner after the verb or, if there is an object, after verb + object.
Examples
He drives carefully.
She plays the guitar well. 

- Use 2 / We can use very, really, quite before an adverb of manner.
Examples
It rained quite heavily. 
He drives quite carefully. 
She plays the guitar really well.

- Adjetives

- We use adjectives before a noun or after the verb be.
Examples
This is an expensive guitar. 
This guitar is expensive. 

- Adverbs of manner vs adjectives

-- Difference: we use adjectives to describe a noun (before a noun or after the verb be), and we use adverbs of manner to describe a verb (after the verb or verb + object). Compare:
Examples
Robert plays the guitar well. (=We are describing the verb, i.e. how Robert plays the guitar.)
Robert is a good guitar player. (=We are describing the noun, Robert.)
Sara eats slowly. 
Sara is a slow eater. 
 
-- Adjectives ending in -ly: some words end in -ly, but they are adjectives, NOT adverbs: friendly, lovely, silly. We CANNOT transform these adjectives into adverbs of manner.

******* Comparative adjectives – older than, more important than, etc.

- Comparative adjectives: We use "more" + adjective + "than" or adjective + -er + than to compare things or people.
Examples
My car is more expensive than your car.
I am older than my brother.

- Spelling
Adjetive     Comparative     Spelling rule
old          older           In general => + -er
cheap        cheaper         In general => + -er
high         higher          In general => + -er
hot          hotter          1 syllable vowel-consonant-vowel => double consonant + -er
big          bigger          1 syllable vowel-consonant-vowel => double consonant + -er
thin         thinner         1 syllable vowel-consonant-vowel => double consonant + -er
healthy      healthier       2 syllables ending -y => -ier
happy        happier         2 syllables ending -y => -ier
noisy        noisier         2 syllables ending -y => -ier
famous       more famous     2 or more syllables => "more" + adjetive
generous     more generous   2 or more syllables => "more" + adjetive
good         better          Irregular adjetive
bad          worse           Irregular adjetive
far          farther/further Irregular adjetive

- Use 1 / We use the comparative form of an adjective to compare two things.
Examples
Luke is taller than Mathew.
This armchair is more comfortable than the sofa.

- Use 2 / When we compare two things, we can also use the form less + adjective + than (less ≠ more).
Examples
Peter is less popular than Marta. (= Marta is more popular than Peter.)

- Use 3 / If we use a personal pronoun after "than" we need an object pronoun (me, you, him, etc.).
Examples
My sister is taller than me.
His sister is more intelligent than him.

- Use 4 / Before the comparative (more or -er) we can use much (=big difference) or a bit (=small difference).
Examples
He’s a bit taller than me.
Switzerland is much more expensive than Italy.

- Note: We use "than" + the second thing that we are comparing. If we mention the second element of the comparison, we do NOT use "than".
Examples
My brother is taller than me.
I am tall, but my brother is taller. (NOT my brother is taller than.)

******* Superlative adjectives – the oldest, the most important, etc.

- Grammar chart
Adjetive     Superlative        Spelling rule
old          the oldest         1 syllable => + -er/-est
cheap        the cheapest       1 syllable => + -er/-est
high         the highest        1 syllable => + -er/-est
hot          the hottest        1 syllable vowel-consonant-vowel => double consonant + -er/-est

far          the farthest       irregular adjetives
             the furthest       irregular adjetives

- Use 1 / We use the superlative form of an adjective or adverb to compare three or more things.
Examples
Both John and his brother play football, but John is better. 
John and his two brothers all play football, but John is the best.

- Use 2 / After the superlative we use "in" before names of places or before singular words referring to groups of people (class, school, team, family, etc.)
Examples
The Everest is the highest mountain in the world. (NOT of the world)
She is the best student in the class.
He’s the tallest in the family.

- Use 3 / Before the superlative we always use "the" or a possessive adjective (my, your, his, etc.) or noun + possessive ‘s (Paul’s, Elisabeth’s, etc.)
Examples
He is the best.
This is my most expensive jacket.
This is Paul’s best friend.

------> Conjunctions <------

******* Conjunctions: and, but, or, so, because

Examples
My brother is a plumber, and my sister is a teacher. 
They have an apartment in the city and a little house in the countryside. 
-- Use 2 / When we are connecting sentences, we don’t need to repeat the subject (Tom, I, we, she, etc.)
Examples
She got up and left. (=She got up and she left.)
He was looking at us and smiling. (=He was looking at us and he was smiling.)

Examples
(BAD!) I don’t like oranges and lemons.
(GOOD) I don’t like oranges or lemons. 

- AND, BUT, OR

- The items that we connect with "and", "but", "or" should be the same grammar type. Check these common mistakes:
I like dancing and sing. 
I like dancing and singing. (-ing verb and -ing verb)
Would you like to go to the beach or having an ice cream in the park?
Would you like to go to the beach or to have an ice cream in the park? (to-infinitive and to-infinitive)

- SO

- Use 1 / We use so to introduce the consequence or the result of something. The second part of the sentence is the result of the first part of the sentence.
Examples

Examples
What do you do?
Where do they live?

-- Questions with am/is/are: when the verb in the sentence is be, we use am/is/are as the auxiliary verb before the subject. Then the word order is QWAS: (Question Word) + Auxiliary (am/is/are) + Subject
Examples
What is this?

-- In Yes-No questions (questions that we answer saying yes or no) there is NO Question Word, either with do or be.
Examples
Do you speak English?
Does she live here?

Remember: the auxiliary verb in present simple is be or do/does.

- Word order / Present simple (with verb to be)

-- Questions with do/does

------> Word order <------

******* Adverbs of frequency with present simple

- Adverbs of frequency: We use adverbs of frequency with the present simple to talk about how often something happens.

100% Always    ... You are always late.
90%  Usually   ... We usually go to the cinema on Sunday.
70%  Often     ... He often cooks pasta.
50%  Sometimes ... We sometimes order pizza for dinner.
10%  Hardly ever / Rarely ... She hardly ever smiles.
0%   Never     ... They are never at home when we call.

- Position: adverbs of frequency go before the verb, but after the verb be.
-- In negative sentences the adverb of frequency goes after don’t/doesn’t:
Examples
We don’t often go to bed late.
He doesn’t always agree with me.  
-- In questions, adverbs of frequency go after the subject.
Examples
Is he always late?
Do they often go to the library?

- Never / Hardly ever: the adverbs never and hardly ever (=almost never) have a negative meaning, but they are used with a positive verb.
Examples
He is never late. (NOT He isn’t never late.)
They hardly ever go to the library. (NOT They don’t hardly ever go to the library.)

- Expressions of frequency: There are other expressions that we use to talk about frequency: once a day, twice a week, three times a month, every day, etc. These expressions are longer (2 words or more) and they go at the end of the sentence.
Examples
I brush my teeth three times a day. 
I see her every day.
