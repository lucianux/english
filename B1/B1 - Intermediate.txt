- Present simple vs present continuous – Use

-- Present simple

- Use 1: Habits or actions that happen regularly
We use present simple for habits or actions that we repeat regularly.
Examples:
I wash my hair every day.
I never go to the library.
I go to the library on Saturdays.

- Use 2: Facts, States, Permanent situations or things that are always (or often true)
Examples:
I don’t drink coffee.
She’s very tall.
I have two brothers.
Water boils at 100 degrees.
I like soup.

- Use 3: with stative verbs. They are verbs that don’t describe actions. We can use these verbs in present simple but NOT in present continuous. The most frequent are the verbs of the senses (hear, see, smell, look, seem, sound), verbs of opinion (believe, consider, like, love, hate, prefer, think, etc.) verbs of possession (have, own, belong, etc.). Other common non-action verbs are: agree, be, depend, need, mean, remember, realise, recognise, seem, want, etc.
Examples
Please, give me my money; I need it now.
Look at her; she seems sad.

- Use 4: Future timetabled events.
Examples
The train leaves at 4.
The exams start next Monday.
